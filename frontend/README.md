npm install -g pnpm

# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repository-url]

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm start:dev` - Runs the development server with Turbopack
- `pnpm start:build` - Creates a production build (with increased memory allocation)
- `pnpm start` - Starts the production server
- `pnpm lint` - Runs ESLint for TypeScript files
- `pnpm lint:fix` - Fixes ESLint issues

## Project Structure

This project follows the Feature-Sliced Design methodology for better code organization and maintainability. Use the following commands to analyze the project structure:

- `pnpm fsd:check` - Validates FSD architecture using Steiger
- `pnpm fsd:watch` - Watches for FSD violations in real-time
- `pnpm fsd:cruise` - Generates a dependency graph using dependency-cruiser

## Code Quality

The project includes:

- ESLint 9 with TypeScript and Next.js plugins
- StyleLint 16 with Tailwind CSS support
- Prettier 3.5.1 with Tailwind plugin
- Husky 9 for git hooks
- lint-staged for pre-commit checks

## Dependencies

Key dependencies include:

- @hookform/resolvers and zod for form validation
- @radix-ui components for accessible UI elements
- @reduxjs/toolkit and redux-persist for state management
- @tanstack/react-table for data tables
- next-themes for theme management
- sonner for toast notifications
- tailwind-merge and tailwindcss-animate for styling

## Project Structure Explained

The project follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern within the Feature-Sliced Design methodology. Here's the detailed structure:

### Core Directories

- **src/** - Main source code directory containing all application logic
- **src/entities/** - Contains business entities (models) and their basic UI components
- **src/features/** - Contains feature implementations following MVC pattern
- **src/shared/** - Shared utilities, components, and configurations
- **src/widgets/** - Composite components combining entities and features

## Modal Window Documentation

The modal window component is built using Radix UI's Dialog primitives and follows a compositional pattern for maximum flexibility and reusability.

### Component API

The DialogWindow component accepts the following props:

- **trigger** - ReactNode that will trigger the modal to open
- **children** - Render function that receives modal control props

### Render Props

The children render function receives the following props:

- **isOpen** - Boolean indicating modal's open state
- **onClose** - Function to close the modal
- **renderHeader** - Function to render the modal header with title and description
- **renderCloseButton** - Function to render the close button

### Styling

The modal uses Tailwind CSS for styling and can be customized through className props. Key style features include:

- Responsive design with proper mobile handling
- Smooth animations using tailwindcss-animate
- Accessible focus management
- Backdrop overlay with click-outside handling

### Accessibility

Built on Radix UI primitives, the modal implementation includes:

- Proper ARIA attributes and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus trap within the modal
- Screen reader announcements
